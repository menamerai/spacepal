# SPACE-PAL
Solution For NASA SpaceApp 2023:
SPACE-PAL is our solution to the STAR challenge: a chat interface that allow for user submission of an aerospace specification document and ask specific questions about the content therein. Using a NASA-specific format parser, we identify significant specifications and leverage Large Language Models to deliver grounded chat insights based on the found specs. This includes interpretation of various concepts, identification of whether components meet the specification, and recommendations on rewriting areas of the spec.
